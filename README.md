# WP Starter

A modern Full Site Editing WordPress starter theme with AI agent guardrails baked in.

## What this is

A personal WordPress starter intended to be used as a [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) for spinning up WordPress client sites. Built on top of [them.es/starter-fse](https://github.com/them-es/starter-fse), with:

- **PHP 8.3+ / WordPress 6.9+ floor** — see "Hosting baseline" below
- `@wordpress/scripts` + SCSS build pipeline
- An intentionally light theme layer that leans on modern block-theme defaults
- `wp-env` for local development (Docker)
- PHPCS (WordPress Coding Standards) + PHPStan (`szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress`)
- AI agent skills preinstalled in `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/` from the official [WordPress/agent-skills](https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills) pack
- Repo-level `AGENTS.md` (Codex) and `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) to keep agents on modern Gutenberg-era patterns
- A `PostToolUse` hook in `.claude/settings.json` that runs `npm run lint` after Claude edits

## Hosting baseline

**This starter targets modern managed/VPS WordPress hosting and current local dev stacks.** The PHP floor is **8.3**, the WordPress floor is **6.9**.

This is stricter than both WordPress core (which only requires PHP 7.4 in WP 7.0) and the upstream `WordPress/agent-skills` pack (PHP 7.2.24+). That is intentional — the target is Kinsta, WP Engine, Pressable, Pantheon, Rocket.net, Cloudways, and equivalent hosts, plus modern local dev (wp-env, Studio, LocalWP with PHP 8.3+).

**Do not use this template as a base for projects targeting legacy shared hosts.** Fork a different starter for those.

Dependabot alerts on this template currently trace to `@wordpress/*` transitive dependencies — they clear when upstream releases a bump and are safe to accept as-is.

### Tested against

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `@wordpress/scripts` | `32.0.0` |
| `@wordpress/env` | `11.4.0` |
| WordPress | 6.9 |
| PHP | 8.3 |

## Creating a new project from this template

Enabling and verifying GitHub's **Template repository** flag is a manual repository-settings step on GitHub. Confirm that setting before relying on the **Use this template** flow below.

1. On GitHub, confirm the repository has **Template repository** enabled, then click **"Use this template → Create a new repository"**.
2. Clone the new repo locally into `wp-content/themes/<your-slug>/` (or anywhere, if using `wp-env`).
3. Run the **rename checklist** below *before* writing any project code.
4. `npm install && composer install`.
5. `npm run env:start` to boot a local WordPress at `http://localhost:8888` (admin at `/wp-admin`, user `admin` / password `password`).

## Rename checklist (mandatory on every new project)

The template ships with the slug `wp-starter` everywhere. **Use the rename script** — doing this by hand is error-prone (the rename touches ~70 references across PHP, JSON, HTML, XML, and Markdown).

```bash
npm run rename -- acme-client \
  --contributors "acme, jsmith" \
  --theme-uri    https://github.com/acme/acme-client
```

The positional `<slug>` is mandatory. Both flags are optional — pass them if you know the values now; skip them and the script prints a manual-steps reminder.

The script performs the following edits in one pass:

1. **Theme slug** — lowercase, dashes only, no underscores (e.g. `acme-client`, not `acme_client` or `AcmeClient`).
2. **Text domain** = theme slug. Replaces `'wp-starter'` → `'<slug>'` in every PHP i18n call.
3. **Function prefix** — slug converted to `snake_case`. Replaces `wp_starter_` → `<slug_snake>_`.
4. **Pattern slugs** — every `wp-starter/…` pattern slug becomes `<slug>/…` in both pattern headers and template `wp:pattern` references.
5. **`style.css` header** — updates `Text Domain`; when `--theme-uri` is passed, also `Theme URI`; when `--contributors` is passed, writes or replaces a `Contributors:` line.
6. **`composer.json`** — updates `name` field (`vendor/<slug>`).
7. **`phpcs.xml.dist`** — updates the `text_domain` and `prefixes` properties.
8. **`package.json`** — updates `name` field.
9. **`docs/`, `src/`, `inc/`** — PHP snippets, text domains, pattern slugs, and backtick-wrapped `` `wp-starter` `` prose references rewrite too, so a scaffolded project doesn't ship with half the old slug still visible.

Re-running the script with the same arguments is a no-op — the `Contributors:` line isn't duplicated, and already-renamed references don't match the search pattern.

After running, manually review:

- **Directory on disk** — the theme folder name must equal the slug.
- **`style.css`** — `Theme Name`, `Description`, `Author`, `Author URI`, `Tags` are project-specific and not auto-edited. If you skipped `--theme-uri` or `--contributors`, update those lines by hand too.
- **`package.json`** — `author`, `homepage`, `repository.url`, `bugs.url` point at the template's origin repo; update them to the project's.
- **`docs/conventions.md`** — starter-history prose was rewritten along with everything else; the text describing "the starter ships with the slug `wp-starter`" will now name your slug. Adjust or delete as you like.
- **Translation files** — regenerate `.pot` / `.mo` in `languages/` if you carry them over.

Run `npm run verify` afterwards to confirm nothing drifted.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run start          # watch theme assets (assets/main.{js,scss})
npm run start:blocks   # watch theme-bound blocks (src/blocks/**)
npm run build          # production build — theme assets + blocks
npm run build:theme    # theme assets only
npm run build:blocks   # blocks only (skips cleanly if src/blocks/ is empty)
npm run block:new -- <slug> # scaffold a theme-bound block at src/blocks/<slug>/
npm run cpt:new -- <slug>   # scaffold a custom post type at inc/post-types/<slug>.php
npm run lint           # lint JS (same as lint:js; matches the PostToolUse hook)
npm run lint:js        # lint JS
npm run lint:css       # lint SCSS/CSS
npm run lint:pkg       # lint package.json against @wordpress/scripts rules
npm run format         # format source/docs (honours .prettierignore)
npm run verify         # block theme standards + lint + phpcs + phpstan + pa11y
npm run a11y           # pa11y-ci against the local wp-env (expects :8888 — verify probes the real port)
npm run rename -- <slug> [--contributors "foo, bar"] [--theme-uri <url>]
                       # rename the theme slug across every file that references it; flags fill style.css
npm run env:start      # boot wp-env (latest stable WordPress, theme mounted)
npm run env:stop       # stop wp-env containers (data preserved)
npm run env:destroy    # stop and delete wp-env containers + volumes
npm run env:clean      # wipe the wp-env database (all environments)
npm run env:cli -- ... # run WP-CLI inside wp-env, e.g. `npm run env:cli -- plugin list`

composer phpcs         # PHPCS against WordPress Coding Standards
composer phpcbf        # auto-fix PHPCS issues where possible
composer phpstan       # PHPStan level 6 with WordPress stubs
```

Build scope: `npm run build` runs `build:theme` (compiles `assets/main.{js,scss}`
into `build/`) and then `build:blocks` (compiles `src/blocks/*/block.json` into
`build/blocks/` via `@wordpress/scripts`' standard block discovery). Blocks
auto-register through `wp_starter_register_blocks()` in
[functions.php](functions.php) on `init`. A fresh repo with no blocks is fine
— `build:blocks` exits 0 when `src/blocks/` is empty.

## AI agents

This repo is set up for two assistants in parallel:

- **Claude Code** reads [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and the skills in `.claude/skills/`.
- **Codex** reads [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the skills in `.codex/skills/`.

### Block theme standards

The agent instructions define a nine-item [Technical Contract](CLAUDE.md#block-theme-standards) scoped to the homepage/front-page workflow — tokens, fluid type, template/pattern separation, role-based media, and others. See CLAUDE.md for the scope boundary (non-homepage templates and site chrome are exempt from specific items) and for which items are CI-enforced versus review-enforced. Supporting docs:

- [docs/pattern-composition.md](docs/pattern-composition.md) — how templates, page patterns, and section patterns fit together.
- [docs/media-conventions.md](docs/media-conventions.md) — the role-not-format rule for images, SVGs, and fonts.
- [docs/weight-vs-size-terminology.md](docs/weight-vs-size-terminology.md) — disambiguating "medium" across size, weight, and spacing.
- [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md) — slug substitution, `[PLACEHOLDER]` grammar, and the `TODO(kind):` comment vocabulary.

### Using with an AI agent

The homepage build spec lives at [docs/homepage-build-spec.md](docs/homepage-build-spec.md). Fill the `[…]` fields in the paste-block and hand it to the agent. The spec enforces the Technical Contract and runs `npm run verify` (including the a11y gate) before handing back. It also doubles as human documentation of how the homepage was architected — read it without pasting if you're onboarding onto a project.

Both skill directories were installed from [WordPress/agent-skills](https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills). To update when new skills ship upstream:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills.git /tmp/agent-skills
cd /tmp/agent-skills
node shared/scripts/skillpack-build.mjs --clean
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs \
  --dest=/path/to/this/repo \
  --targets=codex,claude \
  --skills=wordpress-router,wp-project-triage,wp-block-development,wp-block-themes,wp-plugin-development,wp-rest-api,wp-interactivity-api,wp-abilities-api,wp-wpcli-and-ops,wp-performance,wp-phpstan,wp-playground
rm -rf /tmp/agent-skills
```

The installer writes into `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/` at the target's root. Review and commit the diff.

### The `PostToolUse` hook

`.claude/settings.json` runs `scripts/ai-after-edit.sh` after Claude's Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools. The script runs `npm run lint` (JS only — fast). Heavier checks (`build`, `phpcs`, `phpstan`) stay as manual scripts; `CLAUDE.md`'s validation order tells the agent when to run them.

## Custom blocks

Most "custom block" requests are better served by a pattern, a block style variation, or ACF block bindings. The full decision table and scaffolding flow live in [docs/block-authoring.md](docs/block-authoring.md).

When a project genuinely needs a theme-bound custom block:

```bash
npm run block:new -- author-card
npm run build
```

The scaffold generates `src/blocks/author-card/` with `block.json`, `index.js`, `edit.js`, and `render.php` (dynamic server render). `npm run build` compiles it to `build/blocks/author-card/`, and `wp_starter_register_blocks()` in [functions.php](functions.php) auto-registers every compiled block on `init` — no per-block PHP wiring.

Reusable blocks that should outlive the theme belong in a **companion plugin**, not here. See [docs/block-authoring.md](docs/block-authoring.md#theme-bound-vs-plugin-block) for the rule.

For the middle ground — a pattern with fixed shape but dynamic data (author card, pricing tier, meta display) — use **block bindings**. [docs/block-bindings.md](docs/block-bindings.md) covers `acf/field`, `core/post-meta`, and how to register custom binding sources.

## Custom post types

```bash
npm run cpt:new -- case-study
```

Generates `inc/post-types/case-study.php` with a full i18n-ready `register_post_type()` call; the file auto-loads via `wp_starter_load_post_types()` in [functions.php](functions.php). Theme-coupled by default — move to a must-use plugin when the site needs CPTs to survive theme swaps. [docs/post-types.md](docs/post-types.md) walks through the ACF UI vs. code decision, taxonomies, post meta + block bindings, and common rewrite gotchas.

Reusable blocks and non-theme-specific features belong in a **separate companion plugin repo**, not in this theme. Themes swap; plugin-registered blocks survive theme changes. That follows [WordPress's own guidance](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/fundamentals/registration-of-a-block/) on where custom blocks should live.

## Editor curation

The inserter is pre-trimmed to match a design-system-first workflow. [functions.php](functions.php) (`wp_starter_curate_editor`) removes:

- **Block directory** — the "search a plugin block" UI. Admins still install plugins through `wp-admin` normally.
- **Core block patterns** — WordPress's built-in patterns.
- **Remote block patterns** — the WordPress.org pattern directory.
- **Openverse** — the external media category. Local media library is untouched.

[theme.json](theme.json) additionally disables the **custom color, gradient, font-size, and spacing pickers**, so editors can only pick from this theme's presets — no one-off hex values drifting the design system. Delete the relevant lines if a project needs any of them back.

## Deploying

Deployment specifics for the environments this template targets — host-by-host notes, env var conventions, the post-rename checklist, and a minimal CI workflow — live in [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## ACF Pro

Project work typically uses [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) for custom post types, field groups, and options pages. The template ships the integration scaffolding — a `.wp-env.override.json.example` for local installs and a full recipe at [docs/acf-pro-setup.md](docs/acf-pro-setup.md) covering:

- Local `wp-env` flow (copy the example override, paste your license, `env:start`)
- Production install options (project-level Composer via ACF's endpoint, or host-uploaded plugin)
- License activation via the `ACF_PRO_LICENSE` constant
- How to avoid the wp.org **Secure Custom Fields** (SCF) fork swap that was introduced in October 2024

The template does **not** bundle the plugin or commit your license. `auth.json` and `.wp-env.override.json` are both gitignored.

## Accessibility

- **Skip link** — WordPress 6.9 auto-injects a skip link into every block-theme render, pointing at `#wp--skip-link--target`. Every template's `<main>` carries that `id` so core's link lands correctly. Focus styling (`.skip-link`) is token-driven in [assets/main.scss](assets/main.scss) so the theme's palette and spacing apply to core's injected anchor.
- **Reduced motion** — [assets/main.scss](assets/main.scss) honours `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` and neutralises animations/transitions for users who request it.
- **Focus styles** — button *and* link `:focus-visible` outlines are defined in [theme.json](theme.json) and inherited by every style variation (see [styles/dark.json](styles/dark.json) for the pattern).
- **Automated a11y gate** — [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci) runs against the live wp-env instance. Defaults in [.pa11yci.json](.pa11yci.json) set the standard (WCAG 2 AA) and Chromium launch args; the URL list is supplied at invocation time. `npm run verify` asks wp-env for its actual home URL (`wp option get home`) — wp-env shifts off the default port 8888 when another project already holds it, so a hardcoded 8888 would silently test the wrong site. When wp-env is reachable the gate is real (any violation fails verify); when it isn't, verify emits a yellow warning and continues so non-a11y workflows aren't blocked. Typical flow: `npm run env:start && npm run verify`. To exercise the gate directly against the default port, `npm run a11y` hits `http://localhost:8888/` and `/?p=1` — edit the script in [package.json](package.json) to add more URLs, or prefer a different tool (axe-core, lighthouse-ci) and swap it in; the script name is the only contract verify looks for.
