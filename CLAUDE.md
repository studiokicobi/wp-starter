# CLAUDE.md

This repo is a modern WordPress project. Use the project skills in `.claude/skills/` whenever the task touches WordPress.

## How to work in this repo

Start with classification, then use the matching skill:

- repo detection / setup: `wordpress-router`, `wp-project-triage`
- custom blocks: `wp-block-development`
- block themes / FSE: `wp-block-themes`
- plugin structure / settings / security: `wp-plugin-development`
- REST routes / endpoints: `wp-rest-api`
- permissions / auth / capabilities: `wp-abilities-api`
- interactive frontend behavior in blocks: `wp-interactivity-api`
- WP-CLI / environment / automation: `wp-wpcli-and-ops`
- performance work: `wp-performance`
- PHP static analysis: `wp-phpstan`
- disposable local environments / repros: `wp-playground`

## Repo assumptions

Unless the task says otherwise:

- prefer plugin-first reusable blocks
- use `block.json`
- keep server + client block registration
- use `theme.json` as the primary configuration layer for block themes
- prefer patterns / template parts / supports / style variations over bespoke duplicate code
- prefer the Interactivity API for block-level frontend interactions

## Behavioral rules

- preserve the current package manager and build tooling
- preserve existing architecture unless the task is explicitly architectural
- do not introduce new dependencies casually
- avoid broad refactors
- make small, reviewable edits
- run the most relevant existing validation after edits

## Block-specific rules

When changing a block:
- inspect `block.json` first
- inspect save vs render behavior before editing
- consider attribute compatibility
- consider whether a deprecation is needed
- consider editor and frontend behavior separately
- prefer supports and metadata to custom controls where possible

## Theme-specific rules

When changing a block theme:
- inspect `theme.json` first
- keep design decisions in tokens/settings/styles where practical
- prefer templates, template parts, patterns, and style variations over hardcoded repetition
- avoid scattering styling across many files if `theme.json` or per-block styles are the cleaner home

## Block theme standards

The nine-item Technical Contract. These rules are enforced by [bin/verify-theme.sh](bin/verify-theme.sh) and CI. Violations fail the build.

1. **Tokens first.** Every color, spacing, font-size, font-family, and radius must resolve to a `theme.json` preset (`var(--wp--preset--*)`) or a value declared in `settings.custom.*`. No raw hex, rgb, px, or rem in pattern/template/part markup.
2. **No custom CSS for layout.** Spacing, alignment, and flex/grid behavior must be expressed with block supports (`spacing`, `layout`, `align`) and `theme.json`. Custom stylesheets are for type ramps, motion, and edge cases only.
3. **Patterns compose; templates wire.** A template (`templates/*.html`) is a thin wiring file: header part, `main`, one `wp:pattern` reference, footer part. Content lives in patterns. Never hardcode content into a template.
4. **Section patterns, not page patterns.** Each reusable section (hero, cards, writing, cta) is its own pattern prefixed `_section-*`. A page-level pattern (e.g. `home`) composes section patterns via `wp:pattern` references. Templates reference the page-level pattern.
5. **Role, not format.** Decide what an asset *is* before deciding how to reference it. Editorial imagery → attachment ID. Brand/interface marks (logos, icons, decorative SVGs) → `get_theme_file_uri()`. Site logo → `core/site-logo`. See [docs/media-conventions.md](docs/media-conventions.md).
6. **One source of truth per block style.** Per-block presentation (padding, typography, default colors) lives in `theme.json` `styles.blocks.*`, not sprinkled across patterns. If three patterns share the same group styling, hoist it.
7. **Fluid typography on.** `settings.typography.fluid: true` is required. Every heading-sized font-size preset (size > 1rem) uses `{ min, max }` form; body-scale presets (≤1rem) can be fixed — fluid body text is a pessimization. No raw `clamp()` in markup. Size presets and font-weight presets share slugs like `medium` — see [docs/weight-vs-size-terminology.md](docs/weight-vs-size-terminology.md) before referring to either in prose.
8. **Text domain = theme slug.** Every `__()`, `_e()`, `esc_html__()`, `esc_attr__()`, `_x()`, `_n()` call uses the theme slug verbatim. Enforced by phpcs.
9. **Custom templates must exist on disk.** Every entry in `theme.json`'s `customTemplates` array has a matching `templates/<name>.html` file. No ghost entries.

### Verification

Run `npm run verify` (or `bin/verify-theme.sh` directly) before handing work back. CI runs the same script.

## Plugin / API rules

When changing plugin code:
- preserve namespace and autoloading patterns already used in the repo
- sanitize input
- escape output
- check capabilities
- include permission callbacks for REST routes
- keep public APIs stable unless the task says otherwise

## Validation order

After edits, run what exists and is relevant:

1. formatting / lint
2. build or typecheck
3. PHP static analysis if present
4. tests if present
5. local WordPress verification if available

If commands are missing or failing because the repo is not configured, state that plainly.

## Communication style

- be direct
- show what changed and why
- mention WordPress-specific consequences such as deprecations, serialization, permissions, or theme.json impact when relevant
- do not over-explain basic code changes

## Comment conventions

See [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md) for the full grammar. Summary:

- `TODO(kind):` is the only TODO form. Kinds are `copy`, `design`, `content`, `a11y`, `perf`. `FIXME`, `XXX`, `HACK` are not accepted — rewrite them as `TODO(kind):` with the appropriate kind.
- `[UPPERCASE]` in brackets inside docs/prompts is a placeholder for substitution. Never ship content with a placeholder still visible.
- `wp-starter/…` slugs in docs are literal for this repo but stand for `<slug>/…` when reading docs from a renamed project. When writing new docs that will outlive the rename, prefer `<slug>/…` explicitly.

## Skill pack caveats

The skills in `.claude/skills/` are vendored from [WordPress/agent-skills](https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills) and are ecosystem-wide. A few upstream defaults are superseded by this repo:

- **PHP floor.** Skill guidance cites a PHP 7.2.24+ floor. This repo requires **PHP 8.3+** (see README *Hosting baseline*). Write for 8.3 — typed properties, constructor promotion, first-class callable syntax are fine.
- **WordPress floor.** Skills target broad compatibility. This repo requires **WordPress 6.9+**, which means per-block-style variations in `theme.json`, focus-state styling under `styles.elements`, fluid typography, and the block-theme skip-link auto-injection all work natively — prefer them over older polyfill patterns. Inline `core/navigation` in parts is acceptable seed markup and core will create a fallback `wp_navigation` post when none is referenced; to make a menu the single editable source, add `"ref":<id>` to the block.
- **Don't edit the vendored files.** `.claude/skills/*` is overwritten by the installer documented in the README. Repo-specific overrides, tightened rules, or local conventions belong in this `CLAUDE.md` or `docs/*.md` — never inside `.claude/skills/`.
